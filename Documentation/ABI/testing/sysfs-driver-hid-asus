Date:		December 2023
Contact:	linux-input@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Set the mode the ROG Ally xpad operates in:
		- 1 = Game mode
		- 2 = WASD mode
		- 3 = Mouse mode
		This setting applies instantly and applies settings that were previously changed
		under that mode which are:
		- deadzones
		- anti-deadzones
		- button mapping
		- button turbo settings
		- response curves

Date:		December 2023
Contact:	linux-input@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Apply the settings that have been stored in attributes so far. Because there are
		many individual settings across a dozen packets this separation is required to
		prevent spamming the MCU when userspace applications apply many changes at once.
